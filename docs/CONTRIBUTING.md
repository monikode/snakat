# How to contribute 🧐

There are 4 ways to contribute to this project: solving or opening an issue, improving our documentation, or fixing a bug not founded yet.

## Before contributing, pay attention to some rules:

1. Don't forget to comment your code.
2. By standard, you must name python packages with lowercase letters and avoid using underline. Take for example the package named as `sprites`.
3. On the other hand, files are named with lowercase letters and, if necessary, you can use underline. Example: `hello_world.py`.
4. Finally, functions and classes are named with lowercase letters and, if necessary, you can use underline for functions and the CapWords pattern for classes. Function example: `function_name`. Class example: `MyClass`.
